## Description 

A simple application that allows a user to save tasks or events for each hour of the day. The application runs in the browser and uses dynamic updates to the HTML and CSS with jQuery.

## Usage

- The calendar displays the current date, with fields for normal business hours 8 AM - 5 PM.
- Each hour has a text field and a button to save the scheduled events for that hour.
- The text field for each hour will show a different background: gray for past hours, red for the present hour, and green for future hours.
- Once an item is saved it is stored in the user's local storage.
